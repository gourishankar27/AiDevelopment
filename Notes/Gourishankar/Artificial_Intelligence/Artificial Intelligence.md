##### Solving problems by **Searching**

    **Uninformed** Search Strategies:
		Breadth-first search (BFS)
		Dijkstra's algorithm or Uniform-cost search
		Depth-first search (DFS)
		Depth-limited search
		Iterative deepening depth-first search
		Bidirectional search

    **Informed** (*Heuristic*) Search Strategies:
		Greedy best-first search
		A* search
		SMA∗ (simplified memory-bounded A∗)
		Bidirectional heuristic search
		RBFS(recursive best-first search)


##### Knowledge, Reasoning and Planning

* Knowledge-based agents
* Logic in general – models and entailment
* Propositional (Boolean) logic
* Equivalence, validity, satisfiability
* First-order logic
* Inference rules and theorem proving
